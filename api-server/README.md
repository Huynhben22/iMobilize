## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Database Connection Errors**:
- Verify PostgreSQL and MongoDB are running
- Check connection credentials in `.env`
- Ensure databases exist and are accessible

### **JWT Secret Missing**:
```bash
# Add to .env file
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-at-least-32-characters-long
```

### **Port Already in Use**:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

### **Groups API Issues** **NEW!**:
- **Group Not Found**: Verify group ID exists using `GET /api/groups`
- **Unauthorized**: Include valid JWT token in Authorization header
- **Rate Limited**: Wait 15 minutes before creating more groups (limit: 5 per 15min)
- **Validation Errors**: Check name uniqueness and content length requirements
- **Private Group Access**: Ensure user is a member of private groups
- **Role Permissions**: Verify user has appropriate role for the operation

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL uses connection pooling (max 20)
- **MongoDB Connections**: Optimized for concurrent operations (max 10)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and DOS attacks
- **Memory Usage**: JSON body size limited to 10MB
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures clean database disconnection
- **Input Validation**: Early validation prevents unnecessary processing
- **Pagination**: Efficient loading of large datasets (forums, events, groups)
